<h3> Introduction </h3>
<p> 
The purpose of this course is to provide an introduction to the basic theory of crystals and crystalline cohomology. Crystalline cohomology was invented by A.Grothendieck in 1966 to construct a Weil cohomology theory for a smooth proper variety \(X\) over a 
field \(k\) of characteristic \(p>0\). Crystals are certain sheaves on the crystalline site. The first main theorem which we are going to prove is that if there is a lift \(X_W\) of \(X\) to the Witt ring \(W(k)\), then the category of integrable quasi-coherent crystals is equivalent to the category of quasi-nilpotent connection of
\(X_W/W\). Then we will prove that assuming the existence of the lift the crystalline cohomology of \(X/k\) is "the same" as the de Rham cohomology of \(X_W/W\). Following from this we will finally prove a base change theorem of the crystalline cohomology using the very powerful tool of cohomological descent. Along the way we will also see a crystalline version of a "Gauss-Manin" connection.</p>
